# Smart Pension - Technical Challenge
Hi there! Mi name is David Franco, and this repo has the solution I've created for the Ruby technical challenge.

## How to run it
You'll need [bundler](https://bundler.io/) install in your machine. Once you have it, you'll need to run `bundle install` and now you're ready to use this awesome log parser!

As stated in the requirements you can run the parser by using the file called `parser.rb`. It receives a list of paths to parse (not only one). For example: `./parser.rb log/webserver.log`

## Considerations
Based on the requirements, TDD and SOLID principles were mandatory. Most of the 'business logic' was coded following both practices. However, parser.rb file lacks of coverage. I'd like to add the coverage but it would imply some research on best practices for testing CLI scripts and I honestly didn't allocate enough time for solving the challenge, my plan was timeboxing it at 3hs max.
